# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Program

A simple Python program to encrypt or decrypt text using a Caesar cipher. The program takes a text input and a shift key from the user and either encodes or decodes the message based on the key.

## Features
- **Encrypt Text**: Provide a message and a shift key, and the program will encode it using the Caesar cipher.
- **Decrypt Text**: Input a Caesar ciphered message along with the shift key to decode it back to plain text.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jesudeyi/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to either encrypt or decrypt a message.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
